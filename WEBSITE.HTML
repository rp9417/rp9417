<P> Hidimba Devi Temple, locally known as Dhungari Temple,[1] also known variously as the Hadimba Temple, 
is located in Manāli, a hill station in the State of Himāchal Pradesh in north India. It is an ancient cave
 temple dedicated to Hidimbi Devi, wife of Bhima, a figure in the Indian epic Mahābhārata. The temple is
 surrounded by a cedar forest called Dhungiri Van Vihar at the foot of the Himālayas. 
The sanctuary is built over a huge rock jutting out of the ground which was worshiped as an image of the deity. 
The structure was built in 1553 by Maharaja Bahadur Singh.[2] </P>

<H1> 2.SOLANG VALLEY.MANALI </H2>
<P> Solang Valley derives its name from combination of words Solang (Nearby village) and Nallah (water stream).
 It is a side valley at the top of the Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh, India 14 km northwest of the resort town Manali on the way to Rohtang Pass,
 and is known for its summer and winter sport conditions. 
The sports most commonly offered are parachuting, paragliding, skating and zorbing.

Giant slopes of lawn comprise Solang Valley and provide its reputation as a popular ski resort.[citation needed] 
A few ski agencies offering courses and equipment reside here and operate only during winters.
Snow melts during the summer months starting May and skiing is then replaced by zorbing
 (a giant ball with room for 2 people which is rolled down a 200-metre hill), paragliding, parachuting and horse riding.
 A Ski Himalayas Ropeway was recently opened </P>

<H1> 4.MANU TEMPLE </H1>
<P> Manu Temple is a 7,184-foot-elevation (2,190 meter) summit located in the Grand Canyon, in Coconino County of northern Arizona, United States.
[2] It is situated one mile south of the North Rim's Widforss Point, 1.5 mile (2.4 km) northeast of parent Buddha Temple, and three miles southwest 
of the North Rim's Bright Angel Point. Topographic relief is significant as it rises nearly 3,600 feet (1,100 meters) in two miles above Bright
 Angel Canyon to the east, and 2,200 feet in less than one mile above Haunted Canyon to the immediate west. Its neighbors include Brahma Temple 
and Deva Temple to the east on the opposite side of Bright Angel Canyon. From the South Rim of the canyon it may be difficult to discern Manu 
Temple from the walls of the Kaibab Plateau one mile behind it, but when the lighting and atmosphere are favorable, this butte of great
 proportions can be seen clearly defined.[3]

Manu Temple was named by George Wharton James for the Hindu lawgiver Manu, in keeping with Clarence Dutton's practice of naming 
features in the Grand Canyon after mythological deities.[2][4][5] This geographical feature's name was officially adopted in 1906 by the U.S.
 Board on Geographic Names.[2] </P>

<H1>5. ATAL TUNNEL </H1>
<P>Atal Tunnel (also known as Rohtang Tunnel),[1] named after former Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee is a highway tunnel 
built under the Rohtang Pass in the eastern Pir Panjal range of the Himalayas on the Leh-Manali Highway in Himachal Pradesh, India.
[1][2] At a length of 9.02 km, it is the longest highway single-tube tunnel above 10,000 feet (3,048 m) in the world.[3][4][5] With
 the existing Atal Tunnel and after the completion of under-construction Shingo La Tunnel, which is targeted to be completed by 2025,
 the new Leh-Manali Highway via Nimmu–Padum–Darcha road will become all-weather roads.[6][7]

The tunnel reduces the travel time and overall distance between Manali and Keylong on the way to Leh. 
The route, which previously went through Gramphu, was 116 km (72.1 mi) long and took 5 to 6 hours in good conditions.
 A traveller now reaches the South Portal of the tunnel from Manali, a distance of 24.4 km (15.2 mi) in about 45 minutes,
 goes through the 9.02 km (5.6 mi) long tunnel in about 15 minutes, and reaches Keylong which is 37 km (23.0 mi) away in about 60 minutes
. The new route via the tunnel brings down the total distance travelled to 71 km (44.1 mi) which can be covered in about 2 hours,
 a reduction of around 3 to 4 hours when compared to the earlier route. Moreover, the tunnel bypasses most of the sites that were
 prone to road blockades, avalanches, and traffic snarls.</P>
